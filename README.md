A simple GIF inspector.
==

Given a url, display gif blocks and images.

Usage
==
* Clone the repository.
* Visit the index.html page, either via the filesystem, or over HTTP.

This has been tested in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.

The escaped GIF URL is passed as a query string parameter. There is a bookmarklet which can be used when viewing a GIF, and previously inspected GIFs are displayed with links at the top of the page.

Why?
==

Just because. It is interesting what could be done when dealing with binary formats on the client side.
